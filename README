# 241Final

If you are currently editing any files, put your name and the files you are editing in ONGOING CHANGES.

To do:
need to consider stalemate conditions
checkmove() needs changes:
    when further jumps are required, should check if the 'just jumped' piece is chosen
				     should check if the next jumping location is not the previous location
					    // should prevent jumping back and forth!
more memory free-ing
	// freetree() might not be working correctly, not sure tho

Done: 
Prompt the game tree only on the AI's turn
Create evaltree function
Choose move based on child values
